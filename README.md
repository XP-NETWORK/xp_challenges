<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Multichain NFT Bridge Explorer gives the end client an indication of what is happening with his transaction.
</br>
By saving all the transactions data on our mongoDB we are able to serve and display the following information:

- Departure chain name
- Destenation chain name
- Departure hash
- Destenation hash
- Tx-fees
- Tx-value
- Age
- Method
- Status
- Sender address
- Target address
- Nft uri
- Collection name
- Collection contract address
- Token-id

and more....

<strong>THIS IS THE SERVER SIDE</strong>

<p>
On this repo you will find a controller that routs by urls working with a buisness-logic file that connects directly to the DB,
you will find A big file named "listenrs" wich is devided to EVM's and non EVM's.
Each file holds a document that is manages his relevant socket.

there are 2 main socket listeners on each file :
One that is listening to a Freez entry point and another that is listening to a Withdraw, 
these entry point are defined on the contract itself.
